# Description
Node Express app, using MySQL as database and Handlebars to serve the HTML page. 

The user will be able to choose what type of cat to pet by entering the name or breed into the text field. Once the user hits submit, the cat will be placed into the "patiently waiting" category. From there, the user can choose to pet the cat. Once the kitty has been pat, it will move to the purring category. The app will store all cat information entered, whether the cat has been pet or not.
